We welcome contributions to the content and source code of `IOCLA` course.
You may contribute by:

When opening an issue, please clearly state the problem.
Make sure it's reproducible.
Add images if required.
Also, if relevant, detail the environment you used (OS, software versions).
Ideally, if the issue is something you could fix, open a pull request with the fix.

Use discussions for bringing up ideas on content, new chapters, new sections.
Provide support to others asking questions and take part in suggestions brought by others.
Please be civil when taking part in discussions.

For pull requests, please follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork): create a fork of the repository, create your own branch, do commits, push changes to your branch, do a pull request (PR).
The destination branch of pull requests is the default `master` branch.
